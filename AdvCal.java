//This project is for making a calculator that can handle multiple number sna d operands and compute them in the correct (BIDMAS) sequence.
//Use of arrays for storing numbers in sequence, a for addition, s for subtraction, m for mulitplcation, d for division and 'end' for ending the sequence and calculating
//This projject is more difficylt than intitally imagined. Therefore REGEX will need to be used for digit replacment and character substitution
